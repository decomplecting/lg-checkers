lg-checkers
===========

[Hackathon Presentation](http://goo.gl/5BIFM2)

lg-checkers is our solution to the [Lookingglass Cybersolutions](http://lgscout.com) challenge at the [2014 Baltimore Hackathon](http://baltimorehackathon.com/).

It's built with [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) (A cljs interface to React.js), and [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), an immutable database and [Datalog](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/) query engine in Clojurescript.

It does most of what you'd expect from a game of checkers, plus time travel.
